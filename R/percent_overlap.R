#' Confidence Interval Overlap Percentage
#'
#'
#' The percent_overlap() function is used to calculate the overlap percentage between
#' two numeric vectors. The function uses equation 3 described in chapter 2.
#' The function takes as input two numeric vectors and a desired level of significance and it
#' outputs the percentage overlap between the confidence intervals of population means of the
#' input vectors. If thereâ€™s no overlap of the confidence intervals, e.g., the upper bound of
#' the confidence interval of one vector is lower than the lower bound of the confidence
#' interval of the other vector, a negative percent overlap would be displayed.
