\title{Confidence interval length}
\usage{
cil(x, alpha)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{numeric vector}

\item{alpha}{level of significance}
}
\value{
confidence interval length at the given level of significance
}
\description{
The cil() function calculates the confidence interval parameters of a numeric vector.
It takes in as input the numeric vector and the level of significance desired for the
computation. As an output, it gives the population meanâ€™s confidence interval lower and
upper bounds, as well as a number that represents the length of the confidence interval,
i.e., the difference between the upper bound and the lower bound of the confidence interval.

\dontrun{vecx <- rnorm(100)
cil(vecx, 0.05)}
