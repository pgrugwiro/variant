\title{Confidence Interval Overlap Percentage}
\usage{
percent_overlap(x, y, alpha)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a numeric vector}

\item{y}{a numeric vector}

\item{alpha}{level of significance}
}
\value{
percentage overlap between the confidence intervals of the two numeric vectors
}
\description{
The percent_overlap() function is used to calculate the overlap percentage between
two numeric vectors. The function uses equation 3 described in chapter 2.
The function takes as input two numeric vectors and a desired level of significance and it
outputs the percentage overlap between the confidence intervals of population means of the
input vectors. If thereâ€™s no overlap of the confidence intervals, e.g., the upper bound of
the confidence interval of one vector is lower than the lower bound of the confidence
interval of the other vector, a negative percent overlap would be displayed.
